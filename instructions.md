# Where can you drive an adventure bike in Finland?

#### Off-road

Driving by a motor powered vehicle outside of normal roads (in the 
terrain or “off-road”) in Finland is allowed only by the permission of 
the land owner. The 4th section of Finland's “Act on driving a motor 
powered vehicle 
outside normal roads” says the following:

> ”A motor powered vehicle can not be driven or stopped or parked in the 
terrain or outside normal roads without the permission of the land owner 
or land holder”.

The 3rd section defines the terrain as following:

> “In this Act terrain is defined as an land area or icy water area, 
which 
is not a road and which is not meant for motor vehicle, rail or air 
traffic.”

The roads, off-roads, paths and tracks can be found from ”National land 
survey of Finland's map site”, link (in English):
[Mapsite of Finland](https://asiointi.maanmittauslaitos.fi/karttapaikka/?lang=en)
A dotted line on the map means that it is path or a track of some kind, 
<b>not a road,</b> and not to driven by any motor vehicle. Continuous 
black 
line means that it is a legal road. Snowmobile tracks are <b>only</b> 
for the snowmobiles.

You can always ask the land owner's permission for off-roading. If you 
understand that your off-roading can't cause any disturbance to the 
people or damage to the forest, you have good a chance of getting this 
kind of permission. It's not wise to do off-roading near cities and 
villages. This only 
causes the people being annoyed by the noise. And this great sport of 
ours gets unneeded negative attention. If you have a real dirt-bike, the 
best way for using it is to join to a local association. By doing this 
you can use their dirt- and enduro tracks.

#### Gravel roads

There are over 300.000 kilometers of gravel roads in Finland. These are 
basically open for all traffic and transportation, if the use of the 
road is not forbidden by traffic signs and if the use is occasional.

The owner(s) of a private road can deny the use of his / her / their 
road, if the government or the municipality does not maintain this road 
or the road has not gotten any financial aid for the last ten (10) 
years. This thing is something you can not tell by the condition of the 
road. Therefore if the use of a private road is not denied today, it can 
be denied tomorrow. Freedom brings responsibility!

It is also good to notice that adding a traffic sign to private road 
needs a licence from the municipality. For this reason some private 
roads do not have a traffic sign that prohibits the drive-thru traffic, 
even though the owners do not like this kind of traffic. The permission 
process for getting a traffic sign is long. Some road owners also think 
that traffic signs in the middle of nowhere do not look good.

By our own behavior, we can all influence to the cause are these private 
roads open for all people or not. Here are some basic principles for you 
to follow:

* <b>Do not use a road that has a traffic sign which permits 
traffic.</b>
* <b>Avoid the continuous use of the road.</b> Public use is only 
allowed if 
the use is random.
* When driving thru a yard (or a farm), <b>drive as slow as 
possible</b>, use 
low rpm's and small gears. You must be prepared to stop your bike, if a 
child or a dog runs in front of you from behind a corner or a fence. 
Unnecessary and loud throttling causes unnecessary noise to the people.
* Notice the people and houses and farms which are located near the 
roads. 
People are annoyed by loud noises and high-speed overtaking in 
potentially dangerous.
* Be polite when meeting the owners of these private roads. If You are 
stopped when traveling these roads and you get some feedback, act in a 
polite way. Do not get into any debates or quote the Finnish Act on 
traffic and transportation. The easiest way is to admit your error and 
make a promise that you will avoid the use of this road in the future. 
Removing your helmet usually calms the other one. By this way we all 
maintain the good reputation that we adventure bikers have. And also 
avoid the banning the use of the great gravel roads in the future.
* When facing a horse, <b>drop Your speed to minimum.</b> A complete 
stop is even 
better. Avoid making sudden moves and loud noises. Stop your bike if the 
rider gives you a sign to stop. Raise your speed after when the horse 
has passed you and is a long way from you.

Remember that are more than enough gravel roads in Finland, even when 
they are not all open for public use.
